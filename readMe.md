# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions repository! This repository contains my attempts and solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.
## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/" title="null) is an annual online event that presents a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. It's a great way to practice problem-solving, learn new languages, and brush up on algorithms.Each day in December, from the 1st to the 25th, a new two-part puzzle is released. The goal is to solve both parts for each day.

## How to Run Solutions
To run a specific day's solution: 
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the root of your repository in your terminal.
3. Execute the solution file. For example:
    - For Day 1: python day1.py
    - For Day 2: python day2.py
If you decide to use separate input files for each day, make sure your Python scripts are set up to read from them correctly.
## My Approach
I aim to solve these puzzles efficiently and clearly. My primary language for these challenges will be Python, as seen in the repository. I'll also try to include comments in my code to explain my logic where necessary.
